Effects of Photo Pollution
What is meant by Photo Pollution? We have already heard about four types of pollution named as water pollution, air pollution, noise pollution and land pollution. But photo pollution is totally different from other types of pollutions. Photo pollution is also called light pollution. Light pollution is excessive, misdirected, or obtrusive artificial (usually outdoor) light. It is the caused by the presence of harmful light in environment i.e. anthropogenic light. Light pollution causes many problems in whole community like they it effect organisms, ecosystems and sky glare.
Light pollution has less effect on physical health of humans but it has a very noticeable effect on the psychological health of humans. It will disturb the circadian rhythm of human body. A circadian rhythm is a roughly 24 hour cycle in the physiological processes of humans. It also includes the sleeping process organisms. This process is greatly affected by light exposure during 24 hours. Which causes different diseases like stress, anxiety, depression and sleep sickness. As well as it this will also disturb the cornea of eye. Thus it is very dangerous for mental health of humans and other living organisms.
Light pollution has also effected the glare of sky. If we move a hundred years ago, we could walk outside at night even in a city and see the Milky Way galaxy arch across the night sky. Being able to see thousands of stars was part of everyday life.  By allowing artificial lights to wash out our starry night skies, we are losing touch with our cultural heritage (e.g., what has made us who we are). We are also losing touch with what could inspire future generations. 
In disrupting ecosystems, light pollution poses a serious threat in particular to nocturnal wildlife, having negative impacts on plant and animal physiology. Disrupt both the plants and the ecology they support. As plants use sunlight for photosynthesis. And during night their respiration process is started. But when the plants are exposed to artificial light, both process of get disturbed which disturbs normal growth of plants.
As light has many harmful effects on humans and ecosystem, but it is very necessary part of life. It helps us during night. So we should use light but light should be of suitable should not be of high intensity and it should not be always remained on when we are going to sleep. Then it will not disturb us. And we will remain safe from its side effects.
